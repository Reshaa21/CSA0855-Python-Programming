# Constants
regular_price = 185

# Input: Number of loaves purchased
fresh_loaves = int(input("Enter the number of fresh loaves purchased: "))
day_old_loaves = int(input("Enter the number of day old loaves purchased: "))

# Calculations
fresh_total = fresh_loaves * regular_price
day_old_price = regular_price * (1 - day_old_discount)  # Price after discount
day_old_total = day_old_loaves * day_old_price
total_amount = fresh_total + day_old_total

# Output with proper formatting
